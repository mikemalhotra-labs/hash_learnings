<h1>Base64 Encoding Sample</h1>
<p>
    This file was created to understand how encoded values
    sometimes appear inside markup during testing or debugging.
</p>

    Reviewing how a file changes over time can sometimes provide
    additional insight that is not immediately obvious from its current state.
</p>
<p>
    Encoded strings may not affect the visible output but are still accessible
    when inspecting the file. Paying attention to non-rendered sections
    often reveals hidden details that are easy to overlook.
