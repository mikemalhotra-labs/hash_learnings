# hash_learnings
Notes and small examples created while learning about encodings and basic hashing concepts, mainly for understanding data representation.
This repository contains notes and examples created while learning
about encodings and basic hashing concepts.

Currently focusing on:
- Why data encoding is used
- Difference between encoding and hashing
- Base64 encoding for safe data transmission

Base64 is often used to represent binary data in a readable form.
It is not encryption and can be reversed easily if identified correctly.

Some examples and references here are kept for revision purposes only .
I also learned about other hash techniques that i used in other projects.
